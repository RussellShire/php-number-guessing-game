# Project specifications

- User is welcomed, a number is randomly generated and they are invited to guess it
- Invalid inputs should be handled
- Number of plays, Correct guesses and whether guesses are high or low are saved
- Users are invited to play again
- When users stop playing they should be invited to play another round
- When users decide not to choose another round they should recieve feedback on their performance
- Users should then be invited to play again or terminate the game

# Optional To-Do:

- Currently running in terminal, rewrite for browser
- Handle if the number of high guesses is the same as the number of low guesses
- Give hints, ie. 'it's higher than your last guess'
